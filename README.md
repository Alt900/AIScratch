# Artificial Intelligence taught from basic to advanced all in scratch
Seeing high-level research being published in the community of artificial intelligence is amazing and good for most of us who already understand these concepts, but for those looking to get into artificial intelligence it can create a very steep learning curve and discourage beginners from continuing their learning journey to more advanced models like deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models that make up image generation tools like DALLE-3. This series aims to go back to the foundation that makes up all modern networks and provide a comprehensive all-in-one research pipeline to help beginners stay on track and connect ideas more smoothly in a field saturated with high-level knowledge. As the project grows more sectioned off portions of the project will be created to guide people down a specific direction of artificial intelligence however they may choose, but for now we have just the basics, feed forward neural networks.

## Under construction
DNN with modular activation functions, loss functions, layers, neuron count and distribution, and a graphing function to visualize the network. 

### Roadmap
Deep neural networks 

Convolutional neural networks with its ResNet and DenseNet variants

Recurrent neural networks

Long short-term memory networks
